Package: eclipsimd
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Eclipsim is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Eclipsim uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Eclipsim Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, eclipsimd, and the CLI tool
 eclipsim-cli to interact with the daemon.

Package: eclipsim-qt
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - Qt GUI

Package: eclipsim-tx
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 Eclipsim is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Eclipsim uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Eclipsim Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides eclipsim-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a eclipsim daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
